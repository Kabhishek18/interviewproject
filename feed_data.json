    "question": "What is Python? What are the benefits of using Python",
    "answer": "<p>Python is a high-level, interpreted, general-purpose programming language. Being a general-purpose language, it can be used to build almost any type of application with the right tools/libraries. Additionally, python supports objects, modules, threads, exception-handling, and automatic memory management which help in modeling real-world problems and building applications to solve these problems.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Benefits of using Python:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Python is a general-purpose programming language that has a simple, easy-to-learn syntax that emphasizes readability and therefore reduces the cost of program maintenance. Moreover, the language is capable of scripting, is completely open-source, and supports third-party packages encouraging modularity and code reuse.<br />\r\nIts high-level data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, attract a huge community of developers for Rapid Application Development and deployment.</p>",

    "question": "2. What is a dynamically typed language?",
    "answer": "<p>Before we understand a dynamically typed language, we should learn about what typing is.&nbsp;<strong>Typing</strong>&nbsp;refers to type-checking in programming languages. In a <strong>strongly typed</strong>&nbsp;language, such as Python,&nbsp;<strong>&quot;1&quot; + 2</strong>&nbsp;will result in a type error since these languages don&#39;t allow for &quot;type-coercion&quot; (implicit conversion of data types). On the other hand, a&nbsp;<strong>weakly-typed</strong>&nbsp;language, such as Javascript, will simply output&nbsp;<strong>&quot;12&quot;</strong>&nbsp;as result.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Type-checking can be done at two stages -</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><strong>Static</strong>&nbsp;- Data Types are checked before execution.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Dynamic</strong>&nbsp;- Data Types are checked during execution.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Python is an interpreted language, executes each statement line by line and thus type-checking is done on the fly, during execution. Hence, Python is a Dynamically Typed Language.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/myinterviewtrainer-domestic/public_assets/assets/000/000/924/original/dynamically_typed_language.jpg?1629972224\" /></p>",
